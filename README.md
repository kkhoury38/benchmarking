# Benchmark Tests

This repository contains the required files for publicly available benchmark tests of IoT hardware, performed as part of the evaluation process for possible integration with the [Atman IoT platform](https://atman-iot.com).


## Raspberry Pi 3B signal acquisition â€“ SIPO Register

**Folder**: [raspberry-sipo-register](https://github.com/kkhoury38/benchmarking/tree/main/raspberry-sipo-register)

We have put the Raspberry Pi to the test and benchmarked two of the most popular python libraries, **[RPi.GPIO](https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/)** and **[PIGPIO](https://pypi.org/project/pigpio/#description)**, with regard to their performance in accurately reading interdependent **high frequency** input signals. You  can read more about this test on this [blog post](https://atman-iot.com/blog/raspberry-pi-benchmark).
